# `jhris-website` | `develop` branch

---

## What the hell is this?!?

This `develop` branch is for developing my website. Changes here are
experimental and not final.

## Why!?!?

The reasoning for this is so I can work on my website without interfering with
other people's experience.

## How are you going to host this??

Probably Neocities or Nekoweb. I'll put the link here soon.
